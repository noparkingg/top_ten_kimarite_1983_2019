# top_ten_kimarite_1983_2019

In this repo I have used data from Sumo Wrestling Match Results, found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/sumo-wrestling-matches-results-1985-2019. 

I used the kimarite columns to tally the top ten kimarite per year, every year. This can be found in the CSV in the repo. 
I had fun!
